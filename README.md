# PS-UI-Test

To run this project, clone the respository to your local machine.
Navigate into the project folder.
Run 'yarn-install' to install fresh dependencies.
Run the 'yarn start' command in a terminal (preferrably on VS-Code).
The application will launch and be accessible on http://localhost:3000.
At the same time, a mock data server will launch on http://localhost: 7000.
As both processes are running concurrently, the launch process may be a little slow.
